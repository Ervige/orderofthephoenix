            We can learn a lot from Professor Pomona Sprout, resident Herbology
            whizz and Head of Hufflepuff house – a truly eccentric inspiration.
            Here’s just a few tips, inspired by the lady herself, on how we can
            live our lives in a more Sprout-y way.
          </p>
          <h1 class="article__headline">Embrance nature more</h1>
          <p class="article__paragraph">
            Out of all the subjects at Hogwarts, Herbology strikes us as one of
            the most demanding for a professor. While Defence Against the Dark
            Arts or Charms are highly skilled and impressive in their own way,
            lessons are normally confined to a classroom. With Herbology, there
            are hundreds of magical plants that need attending to across
            multiple greenhouses – and a lot of them are rather dangerous (watch
            out for that Venomous Tentacula). Professor Sprout took care of all
            the flora in the greenhouses but did so whilst planning and teaching
            exceptional lessons, leading Hufflepuff house and taking on extra
            duties wherever necessary. After all, she was the one who grew and
            raised the Mandrakes that restored those who had been Petrified in
            <em>Chamber of secrets</em> . She was clearly unafraid to roll up
            her sleeves, get stuck in and work hard – just like any true
            Hufflepuff.
          </p>

          <h1 class="article__headline">
            This Head of Hufflepuff exemplified kindness
          </h1>
          <p class="article__paragraph">
            Amongst the many teachers at Hogwarts, we always had the feeling
            that Professor Sprout was the most approachable and jolly. You just
            had to look at the way she nurtured the talent of Neville Longbottom
            to see how kind she was. Here was a student that suffered with
            severely low self-esteem and lacked confidence in their magical
            abilities. However, Sprout saw his talent for Herbology, encouraged
            his passion and was unafraid to sing his praises – unlike some other
            professors we could mention who often crushed his spirit… aka Snape.
            Her kindness and investment in him paid off. Not only did he have a
            genuine enthusiasm for her subject (remember his excitement to show
            her his brand-new Mimbulus mimbletonia?) but he ended up following
            in her footsteps and became a Herbology professor himself. Sprout
            gave Neville a chance when others didn’t and that act of kindness
            was one amongst many that shouldn’t be ignored.

              <h2>Her loyalty was never in any doubt</h2>
            </h1>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
              We had no reason to ever doubt Professor Sprout’s loyalty and
              trustworthiness. She was clearly dedicated to Hogwarts and her
              students. When Dumbledore tragically died and the teachers were
              discussing what it meant for the wizarding school, it was she that
              declared that ‘if a single pupil wants to come, then the school
              ought to remain open for that pupil’. While this was an excellent
              example of her loyalty to Hogwarts, it also demonstrated her
              loyalty to Dumbledore’s memory. She was also dedicated to her
              house. Though she was very accepting of those who weren’t a member
              of Hufflepuff, and wasn’t usually one for showing favouritism,
              when both Harry and Cedric were selected as the Hogwarts
              Champions, it was no secret that it was the dashing Hufflepuff who
              had her unwavering support. And who can blame her? It was awesome
              to see Hufflepuff take centre stage for once!
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="article__container">
            <h1 class="article__headline">She was welcoming to all</h1>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
              Apart from that one instance with Cedric, Harry and the Triwizard
              Tournament, Professor Sprout was always welcoming to all pupils at
              Hogwarts. While some of the other teachers clearly had their
              favourites – Professor Slughorn and his Slug Club spring to mind –
              she celebrated the excellence and achievements of all her
              students. It could be so easy for her to focus all her energies
              into rewarding those from her house, especially as Hufflepuff were
              always the underdog who never seemed to win the House Cup. Yet she
              didn’t. She was fair when it came to giving praise and awarding
              house points and kept an open mind. It didn’t matter who you were,
              if you were willing to try, she’d be there to encourage you. And
              if you happened to be willing to take a stand against a certain
              High Inquisitor with an interview in <em>The Quibbler</em>, she
              might even have thrown a few extra house points your way…
