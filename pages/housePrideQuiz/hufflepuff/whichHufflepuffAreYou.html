            Which Hufflepuff are you most like?

          <span class="article__letter">H</span>ufflepuff  house is full of loyal and hard-working characters. But who are you most similar to? In the next in our short series of house-themed articles, we take a look at which notable Hufflepuff matches your personality.
        </h4>
        <h1 class="article__headline">If you are introverted and a little bit awkward… you’re like Newt Scamander</h1>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
            Newt Scamander is not a person that seems to be particularly relaxed around his fellow humans. In fact, this gentle Magizoologist seems far more at home in the company of his beloved magical creatures. It is obvious that he is in his element when taking care of baby Nifflers, Mooncalves and the rest of the magical menagerie that live in his case.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
            Newt tends to be a bit of a loner and his interactions with people can be a little awkward. Who can forget the time he very sweetly and clumsily compared Tina’s eyes to those of a salamander? However, that is not to say that he doesn’t care or feel empathy for others – his kind-hearted nature ensures he does. He is just someone who would prefer the company of a few selected people rather than a large group gathering.        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
            If you can identify with this feeling, then we reckon you’re most like Newt. You’re someone that does enjoy the company of others but can find it draining and you need time to rest and recharge – and there’s nothing wrong with that.

            If you’ve got a reputation for being clumsy… you’re like Nymphadora Tonks
        </h1>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
            Are you somebody that struggles with hand-eye coordination? Have you been known to trip over your own feet? Have you had to replace multiple smashed phone screens? Do people try to subtly move fragile objects out of your reach? Then you’re like Nymphadora Tonks.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
            Tonks was a talented witch, a brilliant Auror and an all-round excellent person… but she was an incredible klutz. From accidentally smashing a plate when sneaking into Privet Drive, to tripping over the umbrella stand, landing flat on her face, and setting off the screeching portrait of Mrs Black at Grimmauld place – it’s easy to understand why she nearly failed the Stealth and Tracking part of her Auror training. So, if you’ve ever felt self-conscious about not being the most elegant person, just remember you’re in good company.

        <h1 class="article__headline">If you’ve been described as an excellent role model… you’re like Cedric Diggory</h1>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
            Cedric Diggory was someone you could look up to. Talented, kind, clever, good-looking and brave – he seemed to have it all. Not only was he selected as the Hogwarts champion for the Triwizard Tournament, but he was also the Hufflepuff Quidditch captain and a Prefect. While he was admired by both the teachers and students at Hogwarts – he was never arrogant or big-headed. When Harry was selected as another Hogwarts champion, he didn’t act bitter or try to sabotage his less experienced rival. Instead, he showed excellent sportsmanship, didn’t participate in the anti-Harry badge wearing and was even willing to share the spotlight with Harry as joint winners of the tournament.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
            If you’re someone who is regularly held up as a shining example for others to follow, then you’re like Cedric Diggory. We can imagine that you were the type of person who would have been captain of a sports team, a volunteer for a charity, a mentor to others or someone who was often trusted to represent their school and show it off in the best possible light.

            If you enjoy being the centre of attention… you’re like Ernie Macmillan
        </h1>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
            Are you somebody that loves a captive audience? Do you enjoy entertaining with a juicy story or exciting titbit? Do you find yourself looking for any gossip that you can use to be the centre of attention? Then you’re like Ernie Macmillan.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
            Ernie certainly knew how to enthral a crowd and was a master at theatrics. He was a natural storyteller and knew the importance of a carefully placed whisper or excitable exclamation. Whether he was confidently proclaiming that Harry was indeed the heir of Slytherin or speculating that Harry must have been a Dark wizard to survive Voldemort’s attack as a baby – Ernie had a real skill for making himself the focus and authority on whatever was being discussed.
        </p>
        <h1 class="article__headline">
            If you’re someone who is unashamedly themself… you’re like Pomona Sprout
        </h1>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
            Professor Sprout was someone who was unafraid to roll up her sleeves and get stuck into any task. Straightforward, no-nonsense and down-to-earth, the green-fingered Head of Hufflepuff knew exactly who she was and didn’t pretend to be anything else. While she held an esteemed position at Hogwarts, she never felt pressured to smarten up her appearance. Her patchwork hat, grubby fingernails and flyaway hair all remained determinedly scruffy. And as someone who was happiest when surrounded by magical flora, fungi… and dirt – a polished look was hardly worth caring about.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
            If you’re someone who is dedicated to their passion (whether that’s gardening, music, art or even stamp collecting), embraces the eccentric parts of their nature, doesn’t care about what they wear and has a very secure sense of who they are – then you’re similar to Professor Sprout.

            If exams and tests bring you out in hives… you’re like Hannah Abbott
        </h1>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
            While we don’t hear much about this hard-working Hufflepuff, we do know that Hannah Abbott doesn’t handle exams well. When it came to the O.W.L.s, Hannah was the first one to need a Calming Draught from Madam Pomfrey – after she burst into tears in the middle of Herbology, proclaimed that she was too stupid to sit the exams and thought she should leave Hogwarts. Poor Hannah also had a bit of a panic in her Charms practical and managed to multiply her ferret into a flock of flamingos (resulting in the exam needing to be stopped while the aforementioned birds were rounded up and removed).
