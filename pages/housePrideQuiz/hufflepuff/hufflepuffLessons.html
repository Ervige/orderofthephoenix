            Our introduction to
            <a href="#" class="article__sublink">Hufflepuff</a> House may not
            have been the greatest – Malfoy’s disparaging remarks inside
            <a href="#" class="article__sublink">Madam Malkin</a>, Hagrid
            alluding to Hufflepuff’s reputation ‘a lot o’ duffers’ – but in true
            laid-back Hufflepuff style, they never really seemed to take these
            unjust judgements to heart.
          </p>
          <p class="article__paragraph">
            Of course they knew it was far from true: most Hufflepuff students
            were anything but duffers (well, with the possible exception of
            Zacharias Smith.) This is the House that gave us Newt Scamander,
            Tonks, Cedric Diggory and Professor Sprout. Why should they be
            bothered by such thoughtless chatter? With their easygoing attitude,
            we could all learn a lot from Hufflepuff.

          <h1 class="article__headline">
            First impressions count, but they’re not the full story
          </h1>
          <p class="article__paragraph">
            If Hufflepuffs are sometimes seen as less bright, it might be
            because of their founder
            <a href="#" class="article__sublink">Helga Hufflepuff</a> reputation
            for fairness. Which is actually pretty unfair. But as the Sorting
            Hat reported, she once said:
          </p>
          <p class="article__paragraph">
            <em>‘I'll teach the lot /And treat them just the same.’</em>
          </p>
          <p class="article__paragraph">
            And if Gryffindor took the bravest, Ravenclaw the cleverest and
            Slytherin the most ambitious, what did that leave Hufflepuff?
            Everyone else.
          </p>
          <p class="article__paragraph">
            But this is definitely not the house of last resort – and more fool
            anyone who underestimates a Hufflepuff.
          </p>
          <p class="article__paragraph">
            Take
            <a href="#" class="article__sublink">Cedric Diggory</a>. When he
            entered the Triwizard Tournament, Ron called him an idiot, Seamus
            Finnigan dismissed him as a “‘pretty boy,”’ and Hermione only
            expressed her admiration for him because he was a Prefect. Good or
            bad, everyone thought they knew who Cedric was. But there was a lot
            more to him than good looks and Quidditch prowess. A fair-minded
            Hufflepuff through-and-through, Cedric also showed immense bravery
            during the Triwizard Tournament, was clever enough to outsmart a
            dragon, and had as much ambition as any Slytherin when it came to
            Quidditch. Because being in Hufflepuff doesn’t mean not possessing
            those qualities. Sometimes, it means possessing them all.
          </p>
          <p class="article__paragraph">
            Basically, never assume anything about a Hufflepuff.

          <h1 class="article__headline">Don't sweat the small stuff</h1>
          <p class="article__paragraph">
            As
            <a href="#" class="article__sublink">Newt Scamander</a> said, whilst
            in pursuit of an escaped in-season Erumpent:
          </p>
          <p class="article__paragraph">
            <em>'My philosophy is that worrying means you suffer twice.’</em>
          </p>
          <p class="article__paragraph">
            This is peak Hufflepuff. They take pretty much everything in their
            stride. They’re not scared of hard work, and they definitely step up
            to the plate when called upon, but they also don’t worry about
            things they can’t control.
          </p>
          <p class="article__paragraph">
            This is because, as Newt himself demonstrates, Hufflepuffs don’t
            have time to worry. They just get on with the task in hand – yes,
            even when the task in question is some mysterious
            Dumbledore-directed crusade. Focus on the big picture and everything
            else will take care of itself. That’s the Hufflepuff way.

          <p class="article__paragraph">
            When it comes to friendship Hufflepuffs are famously loyal, but they
            don’t always get it right first time. Case in point: when Justin
            Finch-Fletchley and Ernie Macmillan convinced themselves (and
            others) that Harry was the Heir of Slytherin, based largely on his
            ability to talk to snakes.
          </p>
          <p class="article__paragraph">
            But the thing about Hufflepuffs is, they aren’t too proud to say
            they’re sorry. Justin and Ernie apologised as soon as they became
            aware of the truth, and ultimately they became friendly with Harry –
            well, apart from that time all of Hufflepuff was mad at him for
            threatening to steal Cedric’s
            <a href="#" class="article__sublink">Triwizard</a> thunder. But even
            Harry understood why they might be annoyed about that, so we’ll let
            them off.

            There's such a thing as being too humble
          </h1>
          <p class="article__paragraph">
            Hufflepuff’s students don’t tend to shout about their achievements.
            If he’d been in any other house, Cedric Diggory could have been
            unbearable – handsome, sporty, a good student – but because he was a
            Hufflepuff, he was also pretty humble. He was certainly never
            arrogant – he helped
            <a href="#" class="article__sublink">Harry</a> with the second
            Triwizard task, and he never seemed as irritated by Harry’s entrance
            into the Tournament as the rest of his house.
          </p>
          <p class="article__paragraph">
            Other Hufflepuffs also possess this quality: Tonks, with her
            self-deprecating jokes; Newt Scamander, with his apologetic shows of
            defiance. In many ways, this innate humility makes Hufflepuffs great
            company. They aren’t reckless, they don’t show off, they dislike
            being the centre of attention. But it also plays into the idea of
            Hufflepuff as the least-recognised house. When Cedric is selected as
            Triwizard Champion they are all delighted, because it’s so rare for
            Hufflepuffs to get any glory. And yet, he is far from the only
            talented Hufflepuff in the building. So maybe it is worth shouting a
            bit louder.

            even-handed teaching approach to Cedric’s attempts to re-play the
